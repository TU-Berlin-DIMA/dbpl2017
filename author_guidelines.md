## Author Guidelines

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting original research. 
Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. 
Submissions should be no more than 10 pages long in the [ACM Proceedings Format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

Each submission should begin with a succinct statement of the problem and a summary of the main results. 
Authors may provide more details to substantiate the main claims of the paper by including a clearly marked appendix at the end of the submission, which is not included in the page limit and is read at the discretion of the committee. 

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the symposium to present their work.

Short papers of at most 4 pages [ACM Proceedings Format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) describing work in progress, demos, research challenges or visions are also welcome.
Accepted short papers may be included or excluded from the formal proceedings, whichever the author(s) prefer.
  
Full and short papers are both due on the deadline, May 12, 2017.
Abstracts of full papers should be submitted by May 5th to aid reviewer selection.
